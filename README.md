# Self Organizing List

List, where access to the most frequently searched elements is the shortest, with two methods of implementation written in C++:

* transpose method - when the element is found it is swapped with the preceding one,
* count method - every element has a count variable which counts how many times that element was found.


Repository also contains PickMorphs.h file with a C++ function which returns an array of indexes of the maximum values of the given vector.
